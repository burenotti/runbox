Testing and scoring solutions
=============================

This library is capable of testing a code it gets. So lets test
something!

For example, let's do something simple: FizzBuzz.

The rules are as follows: if the number is divides by 3, we print
``Fizz``, if it's divides by 5 â€” ``Buzz``. And we print ``FizzBuzz`` if
the number is divides by both.

.. code-block:: python

   n = int(input())

   if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:
       print("FizzBuzz")
   elif n % 3 == 0:
       print("Fizz")
   elif n % 5 == 0:
       print("Buzz")
   else:
       print(n)

For testing purposes RunBox provides ``TestCase`` and ``TestSuite``
protocols. You can implement them by yourself, but here we will use a
built-in implementations.

First of all, let's import all the necessary modules.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fizzbuzz.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 1-12


Then, we have to create a ``DockerProfile``. This model contains information
about docker image that will be used:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fizzbuzz.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 14-19

Secondly, we add the ``Limits``:

*  3 seconds for execution
*  64 MB of RAM.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fizzbuzz.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 21-24

Thirdly, we add a ``File`` object, a piece of code that will be executed.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fizzbuzz.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 26-41

Now we are ready to begin.

Let's create a function that will return the result of our test:

.. code-block:: python

    async def fizz_buzz_test():
        # `DockerExecutor` is a class, that manages container creation
        executor = runbox.DockerExecutor()

        # `TestSuites` allows us to automatically run tests on a given executor
        # It needs `profile`, `limits` and `file` to run
        test_suite = BaseTestSuite(profile, limits, [file])

        # Then we add test cases in test suite
        # `IOTestCase` simply runs the code with a given stdin and checks if the stdout matches
        test_suite.add_tests(
            IOTestCase(b'15\n', b'FizzBuzz\n'),
            IOTestCase(b'25\n', b'Buzz\n'),
            IOTestCase(b'24\n', b'Fizz\n'),
            IOTestCase(b'19\n', b'19\n'),
            IOTestCase(b'12.3\n', b'')  # This case should always fail
        )

        # And now we execute test suite with `executor`
        # `results` variable will contain a list of a TestResults
        results = await test_suite.exec(executor)

        # Don't forget to close `executor`.
        await executor.close()

        return results

We also may need to rate (score) a solution. For that RunBox provides
``ScoringSystem`` Protocol. And a ``BaseScoringSystem``, simple
implementation.

``ScoringSystem`` uses two strategies: ``UnitScoringStrategy`` and
``TotalScoringStrategy``. This provides some flexibility in scoring.

Reimplementation of the ``UnitScoringStrategy`` allows you to change
scoring of a single test case. For example, you might want some tests to
weight more than others according to execution time or something else.

Reimplementation of the ``TotalScoringStrategy`` allows you to change
scoring of the whole test suite. For example, changing this strategy you
can fail the whole test suite if a single test fails or set the minimum
total score, that suite should gain.

Let's score our FizzBuzz, using a built-in ``BaseScoringSystem``.

.. code-block:: python

    async def score_fizz_buzz(results):
        scoring = BaseScoringSystem()

        # `proportional_unit_scoring` is a `UnitScoringStrategy` implementation.
        # It splits the `max_score` between `test_count` test cases.
        # For example, if you have 20 tests and the `max_score` is 100, each test can gain 5 points.
        # `default` is a mark that strategy returns if a test is not ok.
        us = proportional_unit_scoring(
            tests_count=len(results),
            max_score=100,
            default=0,
        )
        # `total_scoring` strategy is a `TotalScoringStrategy` implementation.
        # It sums up the scores of each test case and checks if that sum is above the given threshold.
        ts = total_scoring(default=0, threshold=0)

        scoring.set_total_scoring_strategy(ts)
        scoring.set_unit_scoring_strategy(us)

        # Estimating results will return the result of a `TotalScoringStrategy`
        score = await scoring.estimate(results)
        return score

Now all that's left is we have to glue everything together with a main function.

.. code-block:: python

    # Runbox is an asynchronous library, so we need an async main function
    async def main():
        results = await fizz_buzz_test()
        score = await score_fizz_buzz(results)

        print("Test results:", *results, sep='\n')
        # Output will be as follows:
        # status=<TestStatus.ok: 'OK'> why=None
        # status=<TestStatus.ok: 'OK'> why=None
        # status=<TestStatus.ok: 'OK'> why=None
        # status=<TestStatus.ok: 'OK'> why=None
        # status=<TestStatus.runtime_error: 'RE'> why='Here the TypeError exception'

        print(f"This solution scored {score}/{100} points")


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        asyncio.run(main())
